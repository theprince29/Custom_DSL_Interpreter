This project is a custom-built DSL interpreter made in Python. It lets users write and run scripts in a simple, task-specific language thatâ€™s easy to understand and use for particular purposes.

## Features

- Parse and execute custom DSL scripts
- Extensible command set
- Error handling and reporting
- Easy integration with other Python projects

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

    cd Custom_DSL_Interpreter
    ```


3. **Run the interpreter:**
    ```bash
    python run.py 
    ```

## Usage

Write your DSL command in run.py Example:
```bash
commands_0 = [
    "SET age 20",
    "IF age >= 18 THEN",
    " PRINT 1",
    "ENDIF",
    "IF age < 18 THEN",
    " PRINT 0",
    "ENDIF"
]   
```

Then run:

```
